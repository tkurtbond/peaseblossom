/* Stage 0's protection from voc's collector bug (doc/voc-bugs/
   gc-callee-saved-registers): voc's Heap.GC finds roots by scanning the
   stack, and its way of getting the callee-saved registers onto the stack
   first does nothing in C compiled without optimization, so a pointer held
   only in one of them (rbx, r12-r15 on x86_64; ebx, esi, edi on i386;
   x19-x28 on aarch64) is missed and its object freed while in use.

   This file defines Heap_GC, so the poc that voc links (tools/bootstrap/
   stage0) calls it in place of libvoc's, from its own code and from
   libvoc's alike (the ELF dynamic linker binds every call of a library's
   exported function to the executable's definition). It stores every
   callee-saved register in its own frame (__builtin_unwind_init, which gcc
   and clang both have), which lies inside the stretch voc's MarkStack
   scans, and then calls libvoc's Heap_GC. Checked with the bug's
   reproducer on atla, cymoril, artos and alerik, 2026-10-02.

   Only Heap_GC is replaced, not voc's Heap module, so it fits whichever
   commit each host's voc was built from. */
